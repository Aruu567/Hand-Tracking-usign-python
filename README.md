# Hand-Tracking-usign-python(Made by Aryan)
In this project file I provided the source code there is 2 main source codes (Handtrackingmodule.py and main.py)
You can  run these codes in both pycharm and vs code, when you import or copy all these codes you also have to dwonlaod some liabrary's so be carefull about that.
